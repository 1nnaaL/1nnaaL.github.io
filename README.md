TikTok is a social media platform for creating, sharing and discovering short videos. The app is used by young people as an outlet to express themselves through singing, dancing, comedy, and lip-syncing, and allows users to create videos and share them across a community. You can also watch educational vidoes here, like new english words, deep filipino words, about health, and other useful ideas you want to know. These people who creates videos or contents are called *content creators*.
